## AlphaFold Data Base (AFDB)

The EBI maintains the larest database of AlphaFold structure prediction models at: http://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk

From last class (before Halloween) we saw that the PDB had 244,290 (Oct 2025)

The total number of protein sequences in UniProtKB is 199,579,901

> Key Point: This is a tiny fraction of sequence space that has structural coverage (0.12%)

```{r}
244290/199579901 * 100
```

AFDB is attempting to address this gap...

There are two "Quality Scores" from AlphaFold one for residues (i.e. each amino acid) called **pLDDT** score. The other **PAE** score that measures the confidence in the relative position of two residues (i.e. a score for every pair of residues).


## Generating your own structure predictions

and the top ranked model colored by chain

# Custom analysis of resulting models in R

Read key result files into R. The first thing I need to know is what my results direcvtory/folder is called (i.e. it name is different for every AlphaFold run/job)

```{r}
results_dir <- "HIPPR_dimer_23119/"

# File names for all PDB models
pdb_files <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                        pattern="*.pdb",
                        full.names = TRUE)

# Print our PDB file names
basename(pdb_files)
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)

m1 <- read.pdb(pdb_files[1])
m1
```

```{r}
plot(m1$atom$b[m1$calpha], typ="l")
```

```{r}
plot.bio3d(m1$atom$b[m1$calpha], typ="l")
```


## Residue conservation from alignment file


Find the large AlphaFold alignment file

```{r}
aln_file <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                       pattern=".a3m$",
                        full.names = TRUE)
aln_file
```

Read this into R

```{r}
aln <- read.fasta(aln_file[1], to.upper = TRUE)
```

How many sequences are in this alignment

```{r}
dim(aln$ali)
```

We can score residue conservation in the alignment with the conserv() function.

```{r}
sim <- conserv(aln)
```

```{r}
plotb3(sim[1:99], ylab="Conservation Score")
```

```{r}
con <- consensus(aln, cutoff = 0.9)
con$seq
```
