As it is nearly Halloween and th ehalf way point in the quarter, let's do a mini project at help us figure out the best candy!

Our come from the 538 website and is available as a CSV file:

## Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```
```{r}
flextable::flextable(head(candy, 10))
```


> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

```{r}
candy |>
  nrow()
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

candy %>%
  nrow()
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

My favorite winpercent 

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

candy |>
  filter(rownames(candy) == "Boston Baked Beans") |>
  select(winpercent)
```

```{r}

```

## Quick overview of the dataset

```{r}
#It is a modern, tidyverse-friendly alternative to the base R function summary()
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent is on a 0-100 scale the rest are 0-1 scale

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

That the candy does not contain chocolate

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20)
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_density()
```


> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
# 1. Find all chocolate candy in the dataset
# 2. Find their winpercent values
# 3. Calculate the mean of these values

# 4-6. DO the same for fruity candy
# 7. compare mean winpercents of chocolate vs fruity
# 8. Pick the highest as the winnder

choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.win <- candy[choc.inds, ]$winpercent
choc.mean <- mean(choc.win)
choc.mean
```

```{r}
mean(candy[candy$chocolate==1,]$winpercent)
mean(candy[candy$fruity==1,]$winpercent)
```

```{r}
fruit.ind <- candy$fruity==1
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.ind,]$winpercent
fruit.mean <- mean(fruit.win)
fruit.mean
```

```{r}
candy |>
  filter(chocolate==1) |>
  select(winpercent)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
candy |>
  arrange(winpercent) |>
  head(5)
```

```{r}
ord.ind <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[ord.ind,], 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

default = lowest to highest

```{r}
candy |>
  arrange(winpercent) |>
  tail(5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

Add some color based on the "type of candy"

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy)) #repeat number of candies I have
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "red"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "pink"
my_cols
```
```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent, 
      y = reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```


## Winpercent and Pricepercent

A plot with both variables/columns winpercent and pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent,
       y = pricepercent,
      label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 7)
```

## Exploring the corelation structure 

Now that we’ve explored the dataset a little, we’ll see how the variables interact with one another. We’ll use correlation and view the results with the corrplot package to plot a correlation matrix.

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```


## Principal Component Analysis

The function to use is called `prcomp()` with an optional `scale=T/F` argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

Our main PCA result figure

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col = my_cols)
```

We should also examine the variable "loadings" or contributions of the origional variables to the new PCs

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col = my_cols)
```

Interactive plots that can be zoomed on and "brushed" over can be made with the **plotly** package. it's output is inter5active and willl not render to PDF :-(

```{r}
library(plotly)

#plotly(p)
```
